## 💡 Project Overview
The **Daily Calorie Tracker CLI** is a Python-based console application that helps users log their meals and calorie intake throughout the day. It calculates total and average calories, compares the intake with a user-defined daily calorie limit, and optionally saves the session log to a text file.

This tool encourages mindful eating and basic health awareness while strengthening core Python programming skills such as I/O, loops, conditionals, and file handling.
